            Following his early retirement as a detective from the San Francisco
            Police Department, John Ferguson - Scottie to his friends - becomes
            obsessed with two women in succession, those obsessions which
            trouble his long time friend and former fiancée, Midge Wood, a
            designer of women's undergarments. The first is wealthy and elegant
            platinum blonde Madeleine Elster, the wife of his college
            acquaintance Gavin Elster, who hires John to follow her in Gavin's
            belief that she may be a danger to herself in thinking that she has
            recently been possessed by the spirit of Carlotta Valdes,
            Madeleine's great-grandmother who she knows nothing about, but who
            Gavin knows committed suicide in being mentally unbalanced when she
            was twenty-six, Madeleine's current age. The second is Judy Barton,
            who John spots on the street one day.

            Detective Lieutenant Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) investigates the
            killing of Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney), found dead on her apartment
            floor before the movie starts. McPherson builds a mental picture of
            the dead girl from the suspects he interviews. He is helped by the
            striking painting of the late lamented Laura hanging on her
            apartment wall. But who would have wanted to kill a girl with whom
            every man she met seemed to fall in love? To make matters worse,
            McPherson finds himself falling under her spell too. Then one night,
            halfway through his investigations, something seriously bizarre
            happens to make him re-think the whole case.

            Spade and Archer is the name of a San Francisco detective agency.
            That's for Sam Spade and Miles Archer. The two men are partners, but
            Sam doesn't like Miles much. A knockout, who goes by the name of
            Miss Wonderly, walks into their office; and by that night
            everything's changed. Miles is dead. And so is a man named Floyd
            Thursby. It seems Miss Wonderly is surrounded by dangerous men.
            There's Joel Cairo, who uses gardenia-scented calling cards. There's
            Kasper Gutman, with his enormous girth and feigned civility. Her
            only hope of protection comes from Sam, who is suspected by the
            police of one or the other murder. More murders are yet to come, and
            it will all be because of these dangerous men -- and their lust for
            a statuette of a bird: the Maltese Falcon.

            There have been a rash of child abductions and murders in Berlin.
            The murderer lures the children into his confidence by candy and
            other such child friendly items. Everyone is on edge because the
            murderer has not been caught. The most substantial pieces of
            evidence the police have are hand written letters by the murderer
            which he sent to the newspaper for publication. Unknown even to
            himself, a blind beggar, who sold the murderer a balloon for one of
            the child victims, may have key information as to the murderer's
            identity. The murder squad's work is made even more difficult with
            the large number of tips they receive from the paranoid public, who
            are quick to accuse anyone of suspicious activity solely for their
            own piece of mind that someone - anyone - is apprehended for the
            heinous crimes.

            him one day when he's ordered to meet with gambler Whit Sterling. En
            route to the meeting, he tells girlfriend Ann his story. Flashback:
            Once, Jeff was a private eye hired by Sterling to find his mistress
            Kathie, who shot Whit and absconded with $40,000. He traces her to
            Acapulco, where the delectable Kathie makes Jeff forget all about
